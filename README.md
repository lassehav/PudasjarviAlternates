# PudasjarviAlternates
Alternate landing sites aka. outlanding sites for around Pudasjarvi.

## How to use
You can directly use the .cup file with for example XCSoar software. Just copy the file to your XCSoarData folder, then start XCSoar
and go to Config -> System -> Site Files (btw. this is also where you can see where the XCSoarData folder is located), activate "expert" mode
and add the .cup file to "Waypoint" or "More waypoints". Then you are good to go.

The .kml file can be loaded up in Google Earth for modifying. You can use for example GPS Babel software to convert the .kml file to .cup format.

.cup format specification can be found from here: http://download.naviter.com/docs/cup_format.pdf
